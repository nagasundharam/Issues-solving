problem :
  
CRLF = (Carriage return and Line Feed)  -- windows  
LF = (Line Feed) -- macOs,linux -unix system


CRLF stands for Carriage Return (CR) + Line Feed (LF), which are control characters used to mark the end of a line in a text file. Different operating systems use different line endings:

        Windows uses CRLF (\r\n)
        Linux/macOS use only LF (\n)
